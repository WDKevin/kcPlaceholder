## About
HTML5 introduced a new attribute named placeholder. From W3C:

>The placeholder attribute represents a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry when the control has no value. A hint could be a sample value or a brief description of th$

The placeholder attribute should not be used as a replacement for a label. For a longer hint or other advisory text, place the text next to the control.
The purpose of kcPlaceholder is to introduce this functionality to browsers that do not currently support HTML5, like older versions of Internet Explorer.

## Usage
kcPlaceholder requires no initialization or modification to your current code. Simply load the .js file (and the jQuery libary) to your project and your existing placeholder tags will be functional in browsers that did not previously support them.
